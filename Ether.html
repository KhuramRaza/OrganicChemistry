      <ol>
        <li>Ethers (/ˈiːθər/) are a class of organic compounds that contain an ether group—an oxygen atom connected to two alkyl or aryl
           groups. They have the general formula R–O–R′, where R and R′ represent the alkyl or aryl groups </li>
        <li>Example :methoxyethane-CH<sub>3</sub>OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub></li>
      </ol>

     <div>
    <h3 id="phys-props">Physical Properties</h3><br>
    Ethers  are  classified  as simple or symmetrical, if the alkyl or aryl groups attached to the oxygen
    atom are the same, and mixed or unsymmetrical,if  the  two  groups  are  different. Dithyl ether, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>, is a symmetrical ether whereas C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OCH<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OC<sub>6</sub>H<sub/>5</sub/> are unsymmetrical ethers.<br><br>
The C-O bonds in ethers are polar and thus, ethers have a net dipole
moment.  The  weak  polarity  of  ethers  do  not  appreciably  affect  their
boiling  points  which  are  comparable  to  those  of  the  alkanes  of
comparable  molecular  masses  but  are  much  lower  than  the  boiling
points of alcohols<br><br>

The large difference in boiling points of alcohols and ethers is due
to the presence of hydrogen bonding in alcohols.
The miscibility of ethers with water resembles those of alcohols of
the  same  molecular  mass.  Both  ethoxyethane  and  butan-1-ol  are
miscible to almost the same extent i.e., 7.5 and 9 g per 100 mL water,
respectively  while  pentane  is  essentially  immiscible  with  water . This  is  due  to  the  fact  that  just  like
alcohols,  oxygen  of  ether  can  also  form  hydrogen  bonds  with  water
molecule<br>

  <h3 id="preps">Preperation of ethers</h3>
<p><br>
<h4><b>By dehydration of alcohols</b></h4>
Alcohols  undergo  dehydration  in  the  presence  of  protic  acids
(H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>
). The formation of  the reaction product, alkene or ether
depends  on  the  reaction  conditions.  For  example,  ethanol  is
dehydrated to ethene in the presence of sulphuric acid at 443 K.
At 413 K, ethoxyethane is the main product</p><br>
<img src="assets/img/by dehydration of alcohols.PNG"><br>
The formation of ether is a nucleophilic bimolecular reaction (SN<sub>2</sub>)
involving the attack of alcohol molecule on a protonated alcohol, as
indicated below:
<img src="assets/img/mech for dehydration of alcohols.PNG"><br>
cidic dehydration of alcohols, to give an alkene is also associated
with substitution reaction to give an ether.
The method is suitable for the preparation of ethers having primary
alkyl groups only. The alkyl group should be unhindered and the
temperature be kept low. Otherwise the reaction favours the formation
of  alkene.  The  reaction  follows
SN<sub>1</sub> pathway  when  the  alcohol  is
secondary or tertiary about which you will learn in higher classes.
However, the dehydration of secondary and tertiary alcohols to give
corresponding ethers is unsuccessful as elimination competes over
substitution and as a consequence, alkenes are easily formed

<h4><b>Williamson Synthesis </b></h4>
<p>t  is  an  important  laboratory  method  for  the  preparation  of
symmetrical and unsymmetrical ethers.  In this method, an alkyl
halide is allowed to react with sodium alkoxide.</p><br>
<img src="assets/img/RONA.PNG"><br>
Ethers containing  substituted alkyl groups (secondary or tertiary)
may also be prepared by this method. The reaction involves SN<sub>2</sub> attack
of an alkoxide ion on primary alkyl halide<br>
<img src="assets/img/MECH FOR RONA.PNG"><br>
Better results are obtained if the alkyl halide is primary. In case
of secondary and tertiary alkyl halides, elimination competes over
substitution. If a tertiary alkyl halide is used, an alkene is the only
reaction product and no ether is formed. For example, the reaction of
CH<sub>3</sub>ONa with (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>C–Br gives exclusively 2-methylpropene.
<img src="assets/img/mech for rona 2.PNG"><br>
it is because alkoxides are not only nucleophiles but strong bases
as well. They react with alkyl halides leading to elimination reactions.
Phenols are also converted to ethers by this method. In this, phenol
is used as the phenoxide moiety<br>

<h4><b>Chemical reactions</b></h4>
<h5><b><i>1. Cleavage of C–O bond in ethers</h5></b></i>
Ethers are the least reactive of the functional groups. The cleavage of
C-O bond in ethers takes place under drastic conditions with excess
of hydrogen halides. The reaction of dialkyl ether gives two alkyl
halide molecules.<br>
<img src="assets/img/cleavage ether2.PNG"><br>
Alkyl aryl ethers are cleaved at the alkyl-oxygen bond due to the
more stable aryl-oxygen bond. The reaction yields phenol and alkyl
halide.<br>
<img src="assets/img/cleavage ether3.PNG"><br>
<i><h5><b>2. Electrophilic substitution</b></h5></i>
The alkoxy group (-OR) is ortho, para directing and activates the
aromatic ring towards electrophilic substitution in the same way as
in phenol.<br>
<h5><b>(i) Halogenation</b></h5>
<p> Phenylalkyl ethers undergo usual halogenation
in the benzene ring, e.g., anisole undergoes bromination with
bromine in ethanoic acid even in the absence of iron (III) bromide
catalyst. It is due to the activation of benzene ring by the methoxy
group. Para isomer is obtained in 90% yield.</p><br>

<h4><b>(ii) Friedel-Crafts reaction</b></h4>
<p>: Anisole undergoes Friedel-Crafts reaction,
i.e., the alkyl and acyl groups are introduced at ortho and para
positions by reaction with alkyl halide and acyl halide in the
presence of anhydrous aluminium chloride (a Lewis acid) as catalyst.</p><br>

Anisole reacts with a mixture of concentrated sulphuric
and nitric acids to yield a mixture of ortho and para nitroanisole.<br>
