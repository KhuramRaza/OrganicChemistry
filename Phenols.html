        is a drug under development for the treatment of diarrhea associated with anti-HIV drugs. Additionally, derivatives have been made of
        phenolic compound, combretastatin A-4, an anticancer molecule, including nitrogen or halogens atoms to increase the efficacy of the treatment.

    <h3 id="phys-props">Physical Properties</h3><br>
    Alcohols and phenols consist of two parts, an alkyl/aryl group and a
hydroxyl group. The properties of alcohols and phenols are chiefly due
to the hydroxyl group. The nature of alkyl and aryl groups simply
modify these properties.<br><br>

<h4><b>Boiling Points</b><br></h4>
The boiling points of alcohols and phenols increase with increase in the
number of carbon atoms (increase in van der Waals forces). In alcohols,
the boiling points decrease with increase of branching in carbon chain
(because of decrease in van der Waals forces with decrease in surface
area).<br><br>
The –OH group in alcohols and phenols is involved in intermolecular
hydrogen bonding as shown below:<br>
<img src="assets/img/phy props.PNG"><br>
  It is interesting to note that boiling points of alcohols and phenols
  are higher in comparison to other classes of compounds, namely
  hydrocarbons, ethers, haloalkanes and haloarenes of comparable
  molecular masses. For example, ethanol and propane have comparable
  molecular masses but their boiling points differ widely. The boiling
  point of methoxymethane is intermediate of the two boiling points.<br>
  <img src="assets/img/phy props 1.PNG"><br><br>
The high boiling points of alcohols are mainly due to the presence
of intermolecular hydrogen bonding in them which is lacking in ethers
and hydrocarbons.<br><br>

  <h4><b>Solubility</b><br></h4>
  Solubility of alcohols and phenols in
  water is due to their ability to form
  hydrogen bonds with water molecules
  as shown. The solubility decreases with
  increase in size of alkyl/aryl (hydro-
  phobic) groups. Several of the lower
  molecular mass alcohols are miscible
  with water in all proportions.<br>

  <h3 id="preps">Preperation of Phenols</h3>
<p>Phenol, also known as carbolic acid, was first isolated in the early
nineteenth century from coal tar. Nowadays, phenol is commercially
produced synthetically. In the laboratory, phenols are prepared from
benzene derivatives by any of the following methods:</p><br>

<h4><b>From haloarenes</b></h4>
<p>Chlorobenzene is fused with NaOH at 623K and 320 atmospheric
pressure. Phenol is obtained by acidification of sodium phenoxide so
produced.</p><br>
<img src="assets/img/fromhaloarenes.PNG"><br><br>


<h4><b>From benzenesulphonic acid</b></h4>
<p>Benzene is sulphonated with oleum and benzene sulphonic acid so
formed is converted to sodium phenoxide on heating with molten
sodium hydroxide. Acidification of the sodium salt gives phenol.</p><br>
<img src="assets/img/sulphate.PNG"><br><br>

<h4><b>From diazonium salts</b></h4>
<p>A diazonium salt is formed by treating an aromatic primary amine
with nitrous acid (NaNO<sub>2</sub> + HCl) at 273-278 K. Diazonium salts are
hydrolysed to phenols by warming with water or by treating with
dilute acids</p><br>
<img src="assets/img/diazonium.PNG"><br><br>

<h4><b>From cumene</b></h4>
<p>Phenol is manufactured from the hydrocarbon, cumene. Cumene
(isopropylbenzene) is oxidised in the presence of air to cumene
hydroperoxide. It is converted to phenol and acetone by treating it
with dilute acid. Acetone, a by-product of this reaction, is also
obtained in large quantities by this method.</p><br>

<h3 id="reactions">Reactions of phenols</h3>
Following reactions are shown by phenols only :<br>
 <h4><b>1. Electrophilic aromatic substitution</b></h4>
<p>In phenols, the reactions that take place on the aromatic ring are
electrophilic substitution reactions.The –OH group
attached to the benzene ring activates it towards electrophilic
substitution. Also, it directs the incoming group to ortho and para
positions in the ring as these positions become electron rich due to
the resonance effect caused by –OH group. The resonance structures
are shown under acidity of phenols.</p>

Common electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions taking place
in phenol are as follows:<br><br>

<h4>(i)<i> Nitration:</i></h4> With dilute nitric acid at low temperature (298 K),
phenol yields a mixture of ortho and para nitrophenols.<br><br>
<img src="assets/img/nitration.PNG"><br><br>

The ortho and para isomers can be separated by steam
distillation. o-Nitrophenol is steam volatile due to intramolecular
hydrogen bonding while p-nitrophenol is less volatile due to
intermolecular hydrogen bonding which causes the association
of molecules.<br><br>
<img src="assets/img/nitration2.PNG"><br><br>

With concentrated nitric acid, phenol is converted to
2,4,6-trinitrophenol. The product is commonly known as picric
acid. The yield of the reaction product is poor.<br>
<img src="assets/img/nitration3.PNG"><br><br>

Nowadays picric acid is prepared by treating phenol first
with concentrated sulphuric acid which converts it to
phenol-2,4-disulphonic acid, and then with concentrated nitric
acid to get 2,4,6-trinitrophenol.<br><br>

<h4> <i>(ii) Halogenation:</i></h4>

On treating phenol with bromine, different reaction
products are formed under different experimental conditions.<br><br>
(a) When the reaction is carried out in solvents of low polarity
such as CHCl3 or CS2 and at low temperature,
monobromophenols are formed.<br><br>
<img src="assets/img/halo.PNG"><br><br>

The usual halogenation of benzene takes place in the
presence of a Lewis acid, such as FeBr3 (Unit 10, Class XII),
which polarises the halogen molecule. In case of phenol, the
polarisation of bromine molecule takes place even in the
absence of Lewis acid. It is due to the highly activating
effect of –OH group attached to the benzene ring.<br><br>

(b) When phenol is treated with bromine water,
2,4,6-tribromophenol is formed as white precipitate.<br><br>
<img src="assets/img/halo2.PNG"><br><br>

<h4><b>2. Kolbe’s reaction</b></h4>
Phenoxide ion generated by treating phenol with sodium hydroxide
is even more reactive than phenol towards electrophilic aromatic
substitution. Hence, it undergoes electrophilic substitution with
carbon dioxide, a weak electrophile. Ortho hydroxybenzoic acid is
formed as the main reaction product.<br><br>
<img src="assets/img/kolbe.PNG"><br><br>


<h4><b>3. Reimer-Tiemann reaction</b></h4>
On treating phenol with chloroform in the presence of sodium
hydroxide, a –CHO group is introduced at ortho position of benzene
ring. This reaction is known as Reimer - Tiemann reaction.
The intermediate substituted benzal chloride is hydrolysed in the
presence of alkali to produce salicylaldehyde.<br><br>
<img src="assets/img/reimer.PNG"><br><br>


<h4><b>4. Reaction of phenol with zinc dust</b></h4>
Phenol is converted to benzene on heating with zinc dust.<br><br>
<img src="assets/img/zn.PNG"><br><br>


<h4><b>5. Oxidation</b></h4>
Oxidation of phenol with chromic
acid produces a conjugated diketone
known as benzoquinone. In the
presence of air, phenols are slowly
oxidised to dark coloured mixtures
containing quinones.<br><br>
